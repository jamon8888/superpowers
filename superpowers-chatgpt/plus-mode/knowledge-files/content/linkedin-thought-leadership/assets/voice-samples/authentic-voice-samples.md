# Authentic Voice Samples

Capture examples of YOUR natural writing voice here. The LinkedIn Thought Leadership skill will use these to generate content that truly sounds like you.

## How to Populate This

Copy 5-10 examples of text you've written where you felt most authentic:
- Emails you've sent that felt natural
- Blog posts or articles in your voice
- Slack messages or internal memos
- LinkedIn posts you're proud of
- Presentations you've delivered

## Template

For each sample, provide:

### Sample 1: [Context - e.g., "Email to client about project delay"]

```
[Paste your authentic writing here]
```

**What makes this "me":**
- [Note unique characteristics: casual tone, specific phrases, sentence structure]
- [Example: "I use short sentences and always start with context"]

## Voice Characteristics

Based on my samples, my voice is:
- **Tone**: [e.g., "Direct but warm, professional but approachable"]
- **Sentence length**: [e.g., "Mix of short punchy sentences and longer explanatory ones"]
- **Common phrases**: [e.g., "Here's the thing...", "Let me break this down..."]
- **Perspective**: [e.g., "First-person, lots of 'I've seen' and 'in my experience'"]
- **Technical depth**: [e.g., "High-level with specific examples, avoid jargon"]

## What I Avoid

- [e.g., "Corporate buzzwords"]
- [e.g., "Overly formal language"]
- [e.g., "Hedging with 'perhaps' and 'maybe'"]

### Sample 1: Email to Team About AI Implementation

Quick update on the AI pilot:

We're hitting the same wall everyone hits: data quality. I know, shocking.

Here's what I learned this week: The problem isn't that our data is "dirty." It's that we designed our systems for humans to interpret, not machines. Humans are amazing at filling in gaps. AI isn't.

So instead of a 6-month data cleaning project, we're redesigning how we capture data in the first place. Slower start, faster finish.

Questions? Let's talk Friday.
```

**What makes this "me":**
- Conversational opening ("Quick update")
- Self-aware humor ("I know, shocking")
- Short paragraphs for readability
- Reframe of common problem (data isn't dirty, systems are human-designed)
- Clear next steps
- Direct call to action
