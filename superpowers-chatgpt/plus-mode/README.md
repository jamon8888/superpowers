## Examples

### Creating Feature with TDD

```
[In Superpowers Development project]

You: "Help me implement user authentication"

ChatGPT: "I'm using brainstorming.md to design this feature first.

          Let me ask clarifying questions:
          1. What authentication method?
          2. Where does user data store?
          3. What are security requirements?

          [After design]

          I'm using test-driven-development.md to implement.

          RED Phase: Writing failing test...

          test('authenticates valid credentials', () => {
            expect(authenticate('user@email.com', 'pass')).toBe(true);
          });

          Let me run this to verify RED..."
```

### Debugging with Systematic Process

```
[In Superpowers Development project]

You: "Tests failing with 'Cannot read property of undefined'"

ChatGPT: "I'm using systematic-debugging.md for this error.

          Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

          Let me examine:
          - What property is undefined?
          - Where does this occur?
          - Stack trace details?

          [Investigation continues...]"
