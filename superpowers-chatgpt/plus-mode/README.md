## Examples

### Creating Feature with TDD

```
You: "Help me implement user authentication"

Superpowers GPT: "I'm using brainstorming.md to design this feature.

                  Let me ask some questions:
                  1. What authentication method? (JWT, sessions, OAuth?)
                  2. Where does user data store? (database, service?)
                  3. What are the security requirements?

                  [After design]

                  I'm now using test-driven-development.md to implement.

                  RED Phase: Writing failing test...

                  test('authenticates valid credentials', () => {
                    const result = authenticate('user@email.com', 'password');
                    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
                  });

                  Let me run this to verify RED..."
```

**Notice:** GPT automatically:
- Used brainstorming first (design)
- Switched to TDD for implementation
- Followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- No manual skill selection needed!

### Debugging with Systematic Process

```
You: "My tests are failing with 'Cannot read property of undefined'"

Superpowers GPT: "I'm using systematic-debugging.md for this error.

                  Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

                  Let me read the error carefully:
                  - What property is undefined?
                  - Where does this happen?
                  - What's the stack trace?

                  [Investigation continues through 4 phases]"
```
