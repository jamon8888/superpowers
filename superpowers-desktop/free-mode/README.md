## FAQ

### "Do I need to upload every conversation?"

Yes, free tier has no persistent storage. Upload takes ~5 seconds.

### "Can I use just some skills?"

Yes! Upload `core-workflows.md` for just TDD/debugging/brainstorming, or specific cheat sheets for focused reference.

### "Is all-skills.md too big?"

At 25KB it uploads quickly and provides full library access. Start with this, downgrade to core-workflows.md if preferred.

### "Can I edit all-skills.md?"

Yes! Customize for your needs. But tested workflows are generally better unmodified.

### "Will Claude follow all skills?"

You must explicitly invoke: "Use Test-Driven Development for this". No automatic activation in free mode.
